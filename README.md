## Overview
### Description
An app that generates a music playlist based on workout conditions specified by the user, custom tailored to their established music tastes

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** 
    - Music
    - Fitness
- **Mobile:**
    - Having a mobile audio experience in a dedicated app allows for a much more fluid user experience that is difficult to provide on a mobile webapp.
    - The app could take advantage of iPhone sensors to provide dynamic feedback for a workout
- **Story:**
    - Many people use Spotify to listen to music, so developing this app would extend the functionality of Spotify to help people use it when exercising
    - Spotifit helps users create different playlists of different energy and/or pace for different activities or milestones.
    - For example, no one likes getting a good rhythm to a song while jogging, and then tripping over the beat when the next song is way slower or faster. Spotifit aims to combat this problem.
- **Market:** 
    - The primary audience of this app will be anyone who likes to exercise while listening to music.
    - Spotifit will help them create music playlists that fit their desired workout preferences.
- **Habit:**
    - The users can use this app once they doing fitness, which is based on their fitness frequency. 
    - The app will create playlist for the users and the users will not create any playlist for this app. 
- **Scope:**
    - It will be challenging to implement more dynamic, workout focused functionality however the core functionality is readily available through Spotify's API. We can choose to further customize the retrieved data depending on time.
    - It's core functionality is very clear and extended functionality has a lot of development potential
